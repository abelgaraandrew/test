https://learn.r-journalism.com/en/mapping/leaflet_maps/leaflet/

### install libraries

```{r}
library(leaflet)
```


### make my first map on r!
```{r}
# Insert your latitude and longitude in the code below
# NOTE: Don't get them reversed otherwise you'll end up in the South Pole.

# Initialize and assign m as the leaflet object
m <- leaflet() %>%
# Now add tiles to it
    addTiles() %>%  
# Setting the middle of where the map should be and the zoom level
    setView(lng=-112.346970, lat=33.435340, zoom = 16) %>%
# Now, add a marker with a popup, 
    addMarkers(lng=-77.030137, lat=38.902986, popup="<b>Hello</b><br><a href='https://www.washingtonpost.com'>-Me</a>")

m
